This project uses machine learning to predict whether a person is likely to develop certain diseases, such as diabetes. The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset is commonly used for such tasks. The dataset includes features like age, BMI, glucose levels, blood pressure, and insulin levels, with the target variable being whether the person has diabetes or not. Various classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and XGBoost can be used to predict the outcome.
Tech Stack:
Scikit-learn for machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM).
Joblib to save the trained model.
Streamlit for deployment.
Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizing feature importance, model evaluation (ROC curve, confusion matrix).
Key Steps:
Load and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and normalizing numerical columns.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) and evaluate them based on accuracy and other metrics.
Use cross-validation to optimize the hyperparameters.
Save the trained model and deploy it via Streamlit for real-time disease predictions by users.
